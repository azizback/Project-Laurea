# Project-Laurea
This is deployment manual of the Booking houses website. It is a website where you can book one of three houses with the dates.  The website is created with HTML/CSS and PHP/SQL that is provided on github: https://github.com/azizback/Project-Laurea. There is also SQL file on case you want to check it locally. You can also find it here: https://bookinghouse.azurewebsites.net/index.php

You can see the table of the users, add, update it or delete. On the index page you can see the slide show of the houses and the menu with "Home page", "Contact" and "Booking" buttons. There is small text about the website.

This is how Contact page looks like. It also use the alternate css style, so if you changed it on index page it will continue using the same style, but you can change it in the menu.
